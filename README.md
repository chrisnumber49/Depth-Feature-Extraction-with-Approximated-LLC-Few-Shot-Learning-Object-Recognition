# 3D_object_recognition

## Description
In this Thesis we introduce an image recognition method for the 3D image. 
The overall shape of an object can be represented as a concatenation of local feature histograms that consist of azimuthal angle and zenith angle with histogram of oriented normal vectors (HONV).
However, the appearance variation due to the change of viewpoint might cause the reduction of accuracy, to eliminate this constrain, in locality-constrained linear coding (LLC), the local features are projected into its local-coordinate system instead, 
in Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) layer, max pooling is used to integrate projected features in each sub-region to generate the final representation of object.
Combining all methods above, the classification accuracy in our experiment achieves higher than 81% in grayscale and higher than 92% in depth space with only 30 training samples for each category. 
For the object detection task, we adopt the segmentation based selective search as the region proposal to avoid the computational waste from the conventional exhaustive search method.


## System Overview

We firstly apply the HONV on the depth image, the overall shape of an object can be represented as a concatenation of local feature histograms located by grid sampling which consist of azimuthal angle and zenith angle.
Following, with the extracted features, the codebook will be generated by using K-Means cluster, each cluster centroid will be represented as a codeword for the coding process.
The approximated LLC is used to project local feature histograms into its related code words, to improve the computational efﬁciency. 
K-nearest-neighbor search is firstly performed then solving a constrained least square ﬁtting problem, this drastically decreases the computational complexity and speedup the whole encoding process.
In SPM layer, we adopt max pooling as the pooling method to integrate codes in each subregion then concatenate into 1-dimensional vector for the classifier, the classification result shall be generated.

For the instance testing, we adopt selective search as the region proposal, different from traditional exhaustive search, it makes the final number of generated proposals way less by grouping adjacent regions based on color, texture, size, and shape.
The same procedural in the training stage will be applied on each Region of interest (ROI) windows to generate the representation for the independently classification, in one image, the output will contain one or multiple object confidence score of categories with its bounding box.

The system flow chart is shown as the figure.
